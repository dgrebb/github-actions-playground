# Release Actions: Schedule Deployment

This small action can be dropped into your workflow to:

1. Automatically send the GXT RM team a notification of the upcoming release and deployment.
2. Start the GXT RM scheduling process for scheduling deployment of the release.

After a fix version and release page created, drop this at the end of a workflow to pass in the release's name, link, Confluence page, and other useful information.

A notification and email will be delivered to the team — and the overall process can be tracked in Teams, GitHub, or Jira.
